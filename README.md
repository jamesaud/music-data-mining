# Brief Overview

This is not well documented. Most of the code exists in Jupyter notebooks if you want to clone the repository and read through them

Machine learning to do song rank prediction. I.e. given a song, predict what its rank on the charts will be! Also, genre prediction and interesting search algorithms are explored!
